The following example shows how one can easily create a KML file to visualize 
vector data in Google earth. The same vector datasets as in the I/O example 
is taken.
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
library(rgdal)
setwd("D:/active/moc/dm/examples/data_procd/spatial_data/")
vector <- readOGR("data_2014_subset1.shp", layer = "data_2014_subset1")
```

Creating a KML file is straight forward. Just use the `plotKML` function of the
plotKML library and hend your vector over to the function. In order to visualize
a certain attribute, pass the attribute within []. If your vectors should not be
labled by this attribute but by some other attribute, supply it by the parameter
points_names.
```{r}
library(plotKML)
plotKML(vector["COVRG"], points_names = vector@data$ID)
```
